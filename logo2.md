show :name </pre></code>

**Show** is not as good as label although it does do the same things. The reason being is that a **show** is permanent and the only way to get rid of it is by refreshing the page and it can only go to the top left of the working area.
### Label
<pre><code>make "name (readword[what is your name])
cs rt 90 label :name</pre></code>
